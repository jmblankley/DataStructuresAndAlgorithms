## Description

This program is an exercise to learn dynamic programming algorithms. This program takes in an input file that contains an integer that is the total number of items, an integer that is the total time alloted, and then the items listed out with their names, weight, and time it would take to store. It then uses this file and the dynamic programming algorithm to find the lowest penalty possible.

## Technologies Used

C++, Ubuntu Linux, Github

## Installation and Usage

1. Construct executable `project5` using the command `make`.
2. Execute the program as follows `./project5`.

## Example

**Input:**
test.txt
```
5 11
item1 1 1
item2 6 2
item3 18 5
item4 22 6
item5 28 7
```

Console:
```console
./project5 test.txt -print
TOTAL PENALTY: 35
ITEMS STORED: item1 item2 item5
```

## DevLog
- Constructed README and got some notes written down for initial ideas.
